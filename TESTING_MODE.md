## 🆘 **Troubleshooting Testing Mode**

### Issue: No Results for Questions
**Solution**: Make sure your question includes keywords from the document:
- Good: "What is EJARI?" ✅
- Bad: "Tell me about registration" ❌ (try "tenancy registration" instead)

### Issue: Input Field Not Visible
**Solution**: 
1. Scroll to the bottom of the page
2. Check browser zoom (should be 100%)
3. Try refreshing the page (Cmd+R / Ctrl+R)
4. Check browser console for errors

### Issue: Backend Connection Error
**Solution**:
```bash
docker-compose ps  # Check if all containers are running
docker-compose logs backend --tail=50  # Check for errors
docker-compose restart backend  # Restart if needed
```

### Issue: Responses Are Empty
**Solution**: Check if documents are embedded:
```bash
docker-compose exec postgres psql -U postgres -d legaledge -c "SELECT COUNT(*) FROM documents;"
```
Should show 96 documents. If 0, re-run the embedding script.
